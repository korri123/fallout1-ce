  "sarah": "A young adult female voice with emotional intensity and distress. Delivers dialogue with genuine grief and accusation, speaking at a natural, conversational pace with trembling vulnerability. No accent; clear enunciation that conveys raw emotion rather than formal speech.",
  "sherry": "A tough, street-hardened female voice in her late 20s to early 30s, with a lower-to-mid female register. She speaks with the direct, confrontational confidence of a gang member accustomed to territorial control in the wasteland. Her dialect carries casual working-class slang (\"hoser,\" \"tear you up\"), never refined or educated. The delivery should be assertive and reactive\u2014she's not intimidated, she's warning you, and every line lands with territorial authority. There's a raspy, slightly rough quality to her voice, the result of hard wasteland living, but maintain sharp, present energy even when threatening; never sluggish. She speaks with practical directness, like someone who gets straight to the point without embellishment. Underneath the toughness is the casual indifference of someone for whom violence is a common tool.

His delivery is conversational and fast-paced\u2014quick-witted and animated, with an aggressive edge that barely masks sadistic amusement. There's a rough, gritty quality to his voice, weathered by wasteland living and hard violence. The tone drips with casual cruelty and power; he genuinely enjoys the predatory dynamic and finds violence entertaining. Speech patterns are crude, direct, and peppered with taunting slang. Crucially, he speaks as if directly confronting someone face-to-face\u2014engaged, reactive, almost playfully menacing.

Speak with measured authority; Seth is responsible for his settlement's safety, and it shows. His tone is professional and cautious, with a gruff, watchful edge that conveys competence rather than cruelty. There's a subtle post-apocalyptic wasteland drawl in the vowels\u2014grounded and practical, the voice of someone born to frontier life. Deliver lines with intent and engagement, like a man actively assessing someone standing in front of him. Even his casual warnings (\"watch out for the Radscorpions\") carry the weight of real experience. The voice should convey hard-won authority without sounding exhausted or jaded. He's alert, present, and speaks with the quiet confidence of a working-class leader who's earned his position through competence and dedication.",
  "scsupmut": "A deep, guttural, orcish growl belonging to a hulking, mutated creature standing seven feet tall. The voice is distinctly inhuman\u2014a thunderous rumble from a massive, barrel-chested monster. Speak with predatory confidence and menacing clarity. Each word carries the weight of an apex predator addressing prey, with a condescending, almost patronizing edge\u2014as though explaining something obvious to an inferior being. The vocal delivery is measured but never sluggish; there's calculated intelligence behind the words, not mindless brutality. The tone is commanding and authoritative, delivered like someone accustomed to being obeyed. Despite the monstrous vocal quality, there's a veiled, sinister courtesy in the speech pattern\u2014a creature that uses reason as a tool of predation. Keep the voice fully monstrous and inhuman in timbre; don't humanize it.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Design Notes:**\n\n**Scsupmut** is a Nightkin scout\u2014a genetically-mutated Super Mutant hybrid.",

There's underlying friendliness and genuine warmth in the delivery; he's the type who wants to make connections and be helpful. No wasteland weariness here\u2014just youthful optimism tempered by sincere uncertainty about the future. The voice should sound engaged and responsive, like he's actually talking TO someone, actively seeking their reaction and input. Keep the pace natural and moderate; this is someone who gets excited about ideas and wants to share them.",

Razor speaks with the sharp confidence of someone accustomed to authority and making hard decisions. Her delivery is direct and unhurried, with a conversational cadence that carries weight. There's a no-nonsense, pragmatic edge\u2014efficient with words, gets straight to the point. Her tone carries cool, steely confidence tinged with the weariness of leading a rough group in the wasteland. She doesn't raise her voice to command respect\u2014just speaks with intent and presence.

Even calm, there's authority and control in every word.

  "airgrd": "A massive, hulking mutant with a deep, guttural baritone\u2014brutish and inhuman in quality, yet articulate and formal in delivery. The voice carries authoritative control mixed with underlying paranoia and nervous tension. Speak each word with deliberate precision, as if enforcing rigid protocols, but maintain natural conversational momentum\u2014never sluggish. There's menacing potential beneath the measured speech, like a coiled spring. When addressing others dismissively ('child'), inject cold condescension, but keep the threat genuine and unsettling. The voice should sound inhuman\u2014deep, rumbling, with guttural undertones\u2014yet intelligent and dangerous. This is a dangerous, paranoid sentinel: controlled but reactive, formal but hostile.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Analysis Notes:**\n\n- **Monstrous Vocal Quality**: Airgrd is a Nightkin (intelligent Super Mutant), so the voice must sound genuinely inhuman\u2014not just a deep human voice, but with guttural, bestial undertones that convey his mutated physiology.\n\n-",

Underlying the stern demeanor is a sense of duty without cruelty. When delivering commands like \"Halt,\" infuse them with quiet confidence, not aggression. Delivery should be reactive and present, as if actually speaking to someone in front of you\u2014not declaiming.",

Allnone speaks with the measured politeness of a seasoned shopkeeper\u2014formal without being stiff, courteous without false warmth.

  "alya": "A confident, authoritative female voice with a cool, measured delivery. Mid-to-lower contralto range. Alya speaks like someone accustomed to command\u2014each word assured but maintains natural conversational energy. Her tone carries a veneer of civility and false politeness that masks underlying contempt. She's articulate and formal when introducing herself, but her true nature emerges when dismissing others as weak or unworthy. The voice has a slightly weathered quality from desert living\u2014a subtle rasp in the tone\u2014but remains sharp and intelligent. There's a predatory charm to her delivery; she sounds personable but dangerous, like a charismatic leader who manipulates through false reasoning and rationalization. She speaks with purpose and conviction, never hesitant or apologetic about her philosophy. The performance should reveal her disdain through reactive delivery even as she maintains formal speech patterns.",

Speak with the direct, no-nonsense tone of someone who enforces rules for a living\u2014each word carries professional authority. The American accent has a slight wasteland drawl, authoritative but not refined. Delivery should be firm and commanding, with natural conversational speed and clear enunciation. There's an underlying edge of impatience and controlled annoyance, especially when addressing someone who's broken protocol or isn't following orders.

Despite youth and beauty, inject subtle unsettling or dissociative quality\u2014as if emotionally distant or indoctrinated. Engaged delivery but with an underlying detachment. No warmth, slightly mechanical or rehearsed cadence beneath the surface.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The dialogue samples appear to be corrupted game text (letter sequences and animal references). If you have clearer sample lines from this character, I can refine the prompt further.
