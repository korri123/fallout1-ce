    "abel:106": "[with brutish slowness] Oh, yeah? Your momma!",
    "abel:108": "[angrily, through gritted teeth] I'm gonna kick yer ass if you say that again!",
    "abel:111": "[with menacing calm] You human. Me mutant. Mutant kill human.",
    "abel:114": "[in a raspy croak] Children are not allowed here. This mutant place. Go away.",
    "rd1init:109": "[warmly, with growing enthusiasm] Yea, being a Knight would be great, they see lots of action and get to build all the stuff. [thoughtfully] I haven't decided yet, but I'm leaning towards a Knight myself. [slightly self-conscious] Am I boring you? [earnestly] Some people say I talk a lot but I just don't think they understand. I just have a lot to say.",
    "rd1init:112": "[excitedly] Yea, Scribes have such a creative position. [with genuine wonder] It would be great to think up new weapons, modify old ones, and keep records of every detail of every item in the Brotherhood. [slightly self-conscious] Am I boring you? [earnestly] Some people say I talk a lot but I just don't think they understand. I just have a lot to say.",
    "rd1init:113": "[thoughtfully, a bit uncertain] Yea, I'm still trying to decide. [with sincere conviction] It's so tough, they're both really exciting. [friendly, genuinely kind] By the way, if you want the top bunk just let me know, I don't mind.",
    "razor:100": "[calmly, with measured authority] Hello, what can I do for you?",
    "razor:105": "[with quiet confidence] Razor's the name. I'm the closest thing we have to a leader.",
    "razor:110": "[dismissively] Gang? We're hardly a gang. [with steady command] But I am the leader here.",
    "razor:114": "[gravely, explaining with cold clarity] That's Adytum. It's a slave labor camp run by a group called the Regulators, but they tell everyone it's a \"town\". They come here and take our people to work them until they die. Then they come and take more of us.",
    "razor:118": "[conversationally, with quiet interest] So. What brought you to this corner of the wastes?",
    "razor:122": "[wearily, with underlying frustration] We are just people tryin' to survive. Adytum put us in this position. They keep us down and use our friends and families like animals. [with bitter resignation] We don't even have a way to defend ourselves.",
    "razor:127": "[with dark irony] I wish we were a gang. At least then we'd have decent weapons to defend our selves with.",
    "razor:131": "[flatly, with matter-of-fact delivery] Well, I can't help you with that.",
    "razor:134": "[with tactical precision] We need better weapons. The Gun Runners, a little ways from here, have weapons, but we can't get to them.",
    "razor:137": "[with building intensity, explaining through gritted teeth] The Regulators. They are the ones that really run Adytum. Not Zimmerman. They come here and drag our people back to Adytum as slaves. They kill us when we try to fight them off. Sometimes they just come and kill a couple of us to bring to Zimmerman, so they can say we tried to break into their town, or some other ridiculous story. [with cold contempt] Those sons of bitches even killed Zimmerman's son!",
    "razor:140": "[methodically] There's a Death Claw nest between us and them. We have never even spoken with any of the Gun Runners. The Regulators have the fire power to clear out the Death Claws, but they don't for some reason.",
    "razor:143": "[hesitantly, voice catching with emotion] Josh lived here with me... a... [struggling] I...I mean us. [regaining composure] He knew the truth behind what was going on. The Regulators told him if he ever tried to contact his father or return to Adytum that they would kill him.",
    "razor:148": "[with grim certainty] It's not like any of us can even get close to Adytum. We'd be shot dead before we even reached the gates.",
    "razor:151": "[with measured hope, searching] You would risk your life to help us?",
    "razor:156": "[with quiet weight] Very well. I hope you make the right decision.",
    "razor:158": "[with experienced warning] The Gun Runners are over to the east and then north of here. But be careful - Death Claws are not to be taken lightly. I've seen a Death Claw tear a man in half with one swipe.",
    "razor:160": "[with disappointed resignation] I'm sorry you feel that way. I think it would be best if you leave.",
    "razor:162": "[with composed efficiency] Can I help you?",
    "razor:166": "[dismissively] Gang? We're hardly a gang. [with steady authority] But I am the one they all come to for direction.",
    "razor:170": "[with sudden tension, guardedly] What? Did he...",
    "razor:173": "[explosively, raw fury unleashed] WHAT!!! THOSE FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT BASTARDS! I'LL KILL THEM, I'LL SEND THEM ALL TO HELL!!",
    "razor:176": "[voice tight with controlled rage] ...the Regulators. They were the ones that killed Josh! [with fierce conviction] I never would do any thing to hurt Josh. It's the Regulators who are running Adytum, not Zimmerman.",
    "razor:179": "[voice strained with painful memory, struggling through the words] Josh lived here with me... a... [with difficulty] I...I mean us. He knew the truth behind what was going on. The Regulators told him if he ever tried to contact his father or return to Adytum that they would kill him. [bitterly] They laughed at him... they were so sure he couldn't get to his father....",
    "razor:181": "[with commander's efficiency] How's our plan coming along?",
    "razor:184": "[grimly, with pragmatic realism] I'm not so sure it would help without the threat of violence to back it up. What we really need are some weapons from the Gun Runners.",
    "razor:187": "[methodically] They're a little to the east of here, but there's a Death Claw nest between us and them. We have never even spoken with any of the Gun Runners.",
    "razor:190": "[with sharp concern] What's wrong?",
    "razor:193": "[with steely determination] ....Now we have no choice but to get those weapons from the Gun Runners. Will you help us?",
    "razor:197": "[with sincere appreciation and measured optimism] Thank you for all your help. We're going to invade Adytum, we could use someone like you on our side.",
    "razor:205": "[with cold fury] You (male)Bastard! (female)Bitch! [bitterly] With the Gun Runners gone we will never even have the chance to arm our selves. [with sharp dismissal] Get outta here your not welcome here.",
    "razor:224": "[with professional courtesy] Hi, can I help you?",
    "razor:227": "[with calm authority] The name is Razor, I am the leader of the people you see here. We live here at the whim of the Regulators of Adytum.",
    "razor:231": "[with slight weariness, measured] I have heard that the Regulators still control Adytum. Are you not able to kill them all like you had hoped.",
    "razor:234": "[pragmatically, then with thoughtful pause] We would go with you, but without weapons the Regulators would kill us all. There might be another possibility [Razor ponders a moment] If you could get the Gun Runners to supply us weapons then a number of us could go with you.",
    "razor:146": "Late one night he tried to sneak into town to tell his father what was really going on. I was monitoring the Regulators radio transmissions the night that .. they.. he got ...caught. [sadly, shaking head] Here, it's all on this holodisk.",
    "razor:154": "[with genuine appreciation] Thank you. This really could help us. [nodding] Good luck. [She hands you the holodisk.]",
    "agatha:104": "[with gentle concern] It is a terrible thing when our youth are threatened. The loss of Tandi would be a terrible thing.",
    "agatha:110": "[warmly, thoughtfully] Aradesh loves his daughter very much. It is that love that makes him the man that he is and a pillar of this community. Without that love he would be lost, and Shady Sands would surely follow . . .",
    "agatha:114": "[gravely, with conviction] I feel that she is imprisoned. She was the target of hatred. That hate is very strong to the southeast. I'm sure you will find her there. Good luck.",
    "agatha:119": "[kindly] Hello. You must be the stranger everyone is talking about. [sighing softly] How can I help you?",
    "agatha:126": "[with maternal pride] My name is Agatha. I am the storyteller of Shady Sands. It is my job to keep the history so that we may remember and never forget.",
    "agatha:133": "[apologetically, wearily] I'm sorry, I'm very tired. Could you please come back later?",
    "agatha:138": "[warmly, affectionately] Good day, my child. You look well. You remind me of my own baby.",
    "agatha:144": "[with gentle wisdom] Thank you. Dharma always said that the farmer who plants politeness will walk easy when the season is over.",
    "airgrd:105": "[with a guttural growl] Normals cannot carry weapons here! Halt and identify yourself!",
    "airgrd:111": "[coldly authoritative] Halt! What is your business here, 'child'.",
    "airgrd:116": "[growling, with menacing tension] Your answer does not settle my nerves. Speak quickly and clearly, or I will assume you are here for foul purposes. [threateningly] I assure you that you will not like that...",
    "airgrd:120": "[with grudging formality] You may pass, but next time, follow the proper procedure...",
    "airgrd:128": "[guttural and threatening] You are making a mistake by coming here. Explain yourself or perish...",
    "airgrd:134": "[with defensive intensity, guttural rumble] What kind of foolish bigotry is that, we are 'humanity.' [passionately] We're just as human as you are.",
    "airgrd:137": "[measured but passionate, deep rumbling undertone] My name is Kyle. I was born to a mother and a father, like yourself. [with conviction] The Master just oversaw my rebirth. These muscles, this skin, this strength does not make me any less human than you. [voice hardening] I do not like all that the Unity stands for, but it is the best chance for peace that we have.",
    "alex:103": "[with quiet authority] Halt! Who goes there?",
    "alex:107": "[evenly, matter-of-fact] No strangers are allowed within the walls of Adytum, by order of the mayor.",
    "alex:110": "[calmly but firmly] Look, it is my duty and my honor to serve as the night watch for Adytum, so it is my business. You turn around and leave, or [with underlying steel] I'll have to get serious.",
    "allnone:101": "[with measured courtesy] How may I help you today?",
    "alya:101": "[with measured authority] I am Alya of the Khans. How might I help you today?",
    "alya:109": "[with false reasoning] We do not attack those of Shady Sands. We are from the same place they are. It is only right that they share with us!",
    "alya:113": "[dismissively] You sound just as wimpy as they are. [coldly] Look, if they were in any trouble of starvation, then it is their own fault for not planning ahead. Consider what we do a trade in talents.",
    "alya:118": "[with predatory charm] We give them the most important thing possible. We give their dreary lives excitement.",
    "amber:102": "[warmly] Welcome noble traveler. Have you come here to study?",
    "amber:107": "[with gentle enthusiasm] I am skilled in many of the languages and arts. Perhaps you would like to learn one of those?",
    "amber:112": "[thoughtfully] Ah, we have here a student of life. In a case like this, I can teach you some herbalism, but training takes a while for little result.",
    "amber:116": "[with quiet firmness] You need not be rude. Apologize now, or I won't teach you.",
    "amber:125": "[with delighted interest] Ah, a student of the arts is a rare thing in this world. Perhaps there is hope for you yet. [warmly] Each song is long in time. Which would you like to hear?",
    "amber:140": "[with scholarly pride] I can teach you the ways of the old bards and minstrels.",
    "andrew:103": "Can I help you?",
    "andrew:107": "[matter-of-factly] I'm Andrew. My job is to guard the jail.",
    "andrew:108": "[with calm authority] I'm guarding the jail. I make sure that miscreants don't get in or out.",
    "andrew:112": "[explaining patiently] Someone might leave something to help a prisoner escape. Or someone might get locked inside, and stuck until we could get the keys.",
    "assblow:110": "[with a direct warning] You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place, friend, and we want to keep it that way.",
    "assblow:115": "[coldly] Your weapon, idiot. Killian won't take your arms away, but you'd better damn well keep them in your holster.",
    "assblow:118": "[firmly, with measured authority] You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law. Put your weapon away. Don't draw it unless in self-defense and you won't have a problem with us guards. [sternly] Disobey the law and we will return you to the lawless wasteland--dead or alive.",
    "assblow:124": "[barking] Hey! You! What are you doing sneaking around?",
    "assblow:130": "[with a dismissive shrug] Well, uh, OK. Whatever. Just don't do anything out of line.",
    "assblow:135": "[professionally cordial] Welcome to Junktown. What can I do for you?",
    "assblow:141": "[with dry authority] What does it look like? I'm a guard, and I'm keeping an eye out for strangers like you. And this place is called Junktown. [with a hint of pride] Hey, don't laugh. I happen to like the name myself. We mostly do trading. Sometimes we trade with those stuck up bastards from Hub. [with mild suspicion] Hey, you're not from the Hub are you?",
    "assblow:144": "[apologetically] Then you must know most of the rules. Have a good day. And I am sorry about the bastards part, OK?",
    "assblow:148": "[helpfully] Oh, heck. The place for that is Darkwater's. Killian runs it. It's a little to the north. Killian has the best supplies in town.",
    "assblow:156": "[with regrettable finality] I'm sorry, the gates are closed for the night. Come back in the morning.",
    "barracus:108": "[angrily, with cutting directness] Why would I want to talk with someone who goes around killing kids? Get out of my face!",
    "barracus:109": "[with aggressive challenge] I hear you're pretty tough. But tough don't impress Ton. You got something to say or you wanna get it on? Let's do it!",
    "barracus:117": "[dismissively, irritated] Man, I already talked to you! Take your shit somewhere else!",
    "barracus:122": "[threateningly] What do you want, you stupid zombie? Get outta my face before I break it.",
    "barracus:128": "[coldly menacing] You wanna talk to Ton? Fine. But if I hear the word \"praise,\" I'll kill you.",
    "barracus:134": "[with brutish pride, boastful] Hello, miss. I am Ton, 2,000 pounds of the Master's toughest fighter. I have also been evolved by the FEV into something that you need to check out. Let's get it on, baby.",
    "barracus:138": "[dismissively, with finality] Check it out somewhere else. Ton don't like your company.",
    "barracus:139": "[with measured menace] Fine. You want to play it straight? Sometimes killing's necessary. Sometimes I even like it. But I hear you love killing . . . all the time. Every time I've met a psycho, either he dies, or Ton dies. Ton is still here. So why don't you go elsewhere.",
    "barracus:140": "[with grudging respect] Man, I could learn to like you. You're either an incredible asshole, or you got guts. Either way is fine with Ton, as long as you don't jam me up. You want to join up?",
    "barracus:145": "[with sadistic hunger] To see you suffer. Let's go, hombre, give me what I want.",
    "barracus:150": "[with cold finality] Fine. Talking's over. Make your move.",
    "barracus:153": "[exasperated, shouting] Shit! You're dumber than the zombies! Just get out of here!",
    "barracus:154": "[with zealous conviction] The Master wants peace, and he wants us to get it for him, so we're going to have fun. Capiche?",
    "barracus:160": "[with dark warning, slow and deliberate] It's not healthy to ask the wrong question, compadre. They have all the answers they want you to hear. People who ask the wrong questions, or people who screw up, well, they don't stay around here very long.",
    "barracus:161": "[with grim satisfaction] I do my job. They like it when I do my job. They like it when street trash and Followers stop breathing. It lets the Nightkin do other things. Don't mess with me . . . it ain't healthy.",
    "barracus:162": "[with challenging energy] What are you doing dressed like a zombie? If you got the 'tude, you gotta let it show!",
    "barracus:168": "[sharply commanding] We don't drink in here. Nightkin don't like it. You better get a few more clues before you talk to Ton again.",
    "barracus:169": "[with suspicion and hostility] You're crazy! I could almost like you, except that I have the feeling that people who hang around you don't live long. Get the hell out of here.",
    "barracus:170": "[with frustrated impatience] You stand around this for months and you go crazy as them. What do you want from Ton?",
    "barracus:173": "[with raw aggression] I am losing it in this zombie pit, and I don't need you helping me. Get the hell away from me.",
    "barracus:174": "[matter-of-factly] That's Morpheus. He stays upstairs, except to give sermons. He don't even do that much anymore. He's smart and he's a winner, and that's all that counts. Go see him for yourself.",
    "barracus:175": "[dismissively, searching] You need to go out into the Boneyard, pal. Ain't no slosh in here, and I've looked!",
    "barracus:176": "[with agreeable sharpness] Agree. What can Ton do for you?",
    "barracus:177": "[angrily, shouting] Bitch! You don't know what you're missing! Get out!",
    "barracus:178": "[with menacing slowness] Life is too short for that. Let me show you why you don't want to wait.",
    "barracus:184": "[indignant, shouting] I'm not LITTLE, bitch!",
    "barracus:185": "[scoffing, with contempt] Who believes in that bullshit? They have to program these morons to believe in that stuff anyway.",
    "barracus:192": "[matter-of-factly brutal] When we get the word, we go out and kill people. People like the Followers or some of the more dangerous gang types.",
    "barracus:196": "[with casual menace] Fine. Do what you want. But I'd get out before it becomes unhealthy around here.",
    "barracus:197": "[with venomous contempt] You annoying little piece of shit. You're worse than a Junktowner, you coward. Get the hell out.",
    "barracus:198": "[with bitter satisfaction] What else is there to know? I get to eat well, sleep in peace and kill some of the people who used to screw me over. You want something more from life?",
    "barracus:199": "[dismissively pragmatic] Who knows? Who cares? I get to eat well, sleep in peace and kill some of the people who used to screw me over. You want something more from life?",
    "barracus:200": "[with slow realization, then threat] Hmmm, Ton never thought of that. But if they bother me too much, I break their face. Then they stop bothering Ton. What do you want?",
    "barracus:201": "[with mocking laugh] Converting? Well, good luck. You'll need it.",
    "barracus:206": "[with grim reflection] These people, these zombies, weren't always like this. I could even stand a few of them. Then they got converted. Some of them came out like this. Some of them didn't come out at all. Ton doesn't like it, but these people pay Ton well.",
    "barracus:213": "[threateningly] You talk to Morpheus or to Lasher, or you can bother Ton, and Ton give you more violence than you can handle.",
    "barracus:214": "[with zealous intensity, quick energy] Well baby, what's going on is that there are a lot of zombies chanting, a lot of people dying and the Children are going to take over everything. And there's you and me and nothing else matters!",
    "barracus:219": "[with frustrated growl] Unfortunately, this is the worst place on earth to experience what Ton does best. Too many zombies cramp my style. I'll let you know when I think about some place more convenient . . .",
    "barracus:220": "[with gruff confidence] You'll find out soon enough what happens upstairs. If you tough, you get through it fine. It happened to Ton, and Ton is just fine!",
    "barracus:221": "[sharply threatening] Uh . . . I didn't say anything. You forget what Ton told you or Ton will make you forget, permanently!",
    "barracus:222": "[dismissively harsh] They used to be whiners. But Ton talks too much. You get out of my face.",
    "barracus:223": "[with commanding authority] Fine. You stay low-profile until I give you the word. Then we have fun.",
    "barracus:224": "[with zealous conviction] They're cowards. They set ambushes against our patrols. They send spies and saboteurs. They know they can't win a real fight. The Master says we should feel sorry for them, but Ton just want to kill them. Smart man, Ton.",
    "barracus:225": "[shouting with fervent intensity] We need discipline, fool! We're soldiers now! We obey orders. Killers die, but soldiers win their battles. We're going to beat the Followers. We're going to beat EVERYONE!",
    "barracus:226": "[with casual shrug] Who the hell knows? Maybe it's just Morpheus pulling the strings. Things are good, and if this dries up, Ton goes somewhere else.",
    "barracus:227": "[with calculated caution] Well, don't get too eager. Even with the Nightkin, it's still tough fighting. But if we play it smart, we get out ahead. That's the only thing Ton cares about.",
    "barracus:228": "[with hardened indifference] The conversion isn't easy. You see these people, all these zombies? They used to be like you and me. Ton survived. These people didn't. But why should Ton care about you?",
    "barracus:229": "[with lethal coldness] You don't like the way Ton talk? Then Ton kill you!",
    "barracus:230": "[stuttering with distress] Ton go through it fine. I . . . uh . . . I . . . uh . . . Ton . . . Ton just fine.",
    "barracus:231": "[with bitter nostalgia] I used to be with the Dead Dog gang. Always hungry, always tired. This place is much better for Ton. Why should I worry about anyone else? Nobody ever worry about me.",
    "barracus:232": "[angrily, shouting] You greedy asshole! Get outta here before Ton kills you!",
    "barracus:233": "[with urgent warning] Then get out of here now, before it's too late.",
    "barracus:234": "[with frustrated growl] Nothing important as you and me. Unfortunately, this is the worst place on earth to experience what Ton does best. Too many zombies cramp my style. I'll let you know when I think about some place more convenient . . .",
    "barracus:235": "[with furious indignation] Why you manipulative bitch! Nobody screws with Ton like that!",
    "beca:112": "[coldly commanding] These are sleeping quarters. [threateningly] Now get out of here before I kick your butt.",
    "bitsbob:101": "[quickly, placating] Ok, Ok, I've got your money.",
    "bitsbob:108": "[desperately, voice breaking] I'm sorry. I ain't payin' no more. Do what you want with me.",
    "bitsbob:117": "[nervously, hands up] Hey, I don't want any trouble!",
    "bitsbob:118": "[forced cheerfulness] Hi! Welcome to Bob's Iguana Bits, the family eating place. Can I take your order?",
    "bitsbob:121": "[darkly, lowered voice] He's a mean son of a bitch. You don't want to mess with him. Anything else?",
    "bitsbob:122": "[sighing, resigned] Fine. What do you want me to pay?",
    "bitsbob:142": "[as if reciting] Sure. We got whole iguana on a stick for twenty bucks, and our prime select pieces for eight bucks.",
    "bitsbob:148": "[matter-of-factly] Never seen any of them around here. Water Merchants don't need 'em.",
    "bitsbob:150": "[carefully, with nervous precision] Mr. Decker is a distinguished businessman in a less than distinguished business. Anything else?",
    "bitsbob:153": "[confused, defensive] What are you talking about?",
    "bitsbob:158": "[quickly, backpedaling] Nothing. Sorry to bring it up. Now is there anything else I can do for you?",
    "bitsbob:159": "[with dark humor, carefully] Well, he's dead now, and my cash flow has increased because of it.",
    "bitsbob:176": "[startled, laughing nervously] Wh...what! Oh, I see, you're joking...",
    "bitsbob:180": "[matter-of-factly, weary] You must be new in town if you're asking me about the Water Merchants. Water is life, and you don't get much more powerful than life and death.",
    "bitsbob:182": "[coldly matter-of-fact] If there's anything that involves misery and suffering in the Hub, Decker either controls it or wants to control it. Anything else?",
    "bitsbob:184": "[panicked, defensive] Don't do that! Fine, I've been using some questionable portions. But it's not like I'm committing murder. Doc Morbid's stuff is already dead, isn't it?",
    "bitsbob:188": "[urgently, whispering] Not so loud! I don't need you saying that all over the Hub...",
    "bitsbob:208": "[desperately, pleading] Wait a minute. We've got to find a way to reach a mutual understanding!",
    "bitsbob:212": "[sighing, defeated] Fine. What do you want me to pay?",
    "bitsbob:224": "[desperately, voice rising] No way I'm going for that. I can't afford more than what I'm paying you now.",
    "bitsbob:239": "[with theatrical sympathy, then shifting to salesmanship] Terrible business. Those poor people. Oh, those poor people. Losing their lives in such a ghastly way! Is there anything else I can do for you? Like feed you, perhaps?",
    "boslori:102": "[professionally] Hello, how can I help you?",
    "boslori:119": "[matter-of-factly] But of course, but it's very costly and time consuming.",
    "boslori:126": "[clinically] Okay, which operation did you want to talk about?",
    "boslori:133": "[with practiced efficiency] That's easy to do but there's a long recovery time. It only costs 2000 scripts but takes 3 weeks to heal.",
    "boslori:137": "[with clinical respect] Now that's a difficult operation. It costs 4000 scripts, but the recovery from this operation is only a week.",
    "boslori:139": "[straightforward] This one's not that difficult. It takes about a week and will cost 3000 scripts.",
    "boslori:141": "[with gravitas] This is the most complex and dangerous! It'll take 3 weeks and costs 6000 scripts.",
    "boslori:143": "[with measured concern] This isn't that tough of an operation but it is very costly and time consuming. It will take 3 weeks and cost 5000 scripts.",
    "boslori:400": "[with dry condescension] Hmmm. If anyone here needs an Intelligence Enhancement, it would be you. In fact, I'll do it for 3000 caps instead of the 6000 you would normally need for the operation. [matter-of-factly] I can't guarantee that it will help you, but I think it would be worth a try. It will also take 3 weeks of recovery time. [sarcastically] You probably don't understand this though, do you?",

    "brenden:114": "[with scholarly enthusiasm] Actually, it is a journal that I am keeping. I'm working on a treatise on the social dynamics of the Brotherhood.",
    "brenden:117": "[with intellectual engagement] Indeed. I've been researching information about our predecessors from before the war and about the societies of the outside world. I think that the Brotherhood comes closest in organization to the Knights Templar of the so-called 'Dark Ages'.",
    "brenden:120": "[thoughtfully] Although the Brotherhood places a high emphasis on hard sciences and applications technology, there has been little in the way of research into the soft sciences, like psychology and sociology. [with passionate conviction] For a well-rounded education, we must apply scientific thought to all endeavors.",
    "brenden:122": "[with measured certainty] I've come to the conclusion that the Brotherhood functions mostly like a pseudo-religious organization. We have the strong military hierarchy, combined with codes of honor passed down from our ancestors. Combine this with our technical skills and I think that there are two paths of development for the Brotherhood: a techno-religious dictatorship or a benevolent research society.",
    "brenden:124": "[with analytical precision] Ultimately we have a command hierarchy, with the Elders at the top. The most influential positions, then, are the Elders and the High Elder. A charismatic High Elder could direct the Brotherhood almost completely. [with subtle concern] We need to be careful to make sure that we have a leader who is both strong and visionary. [with quiet confidence] Thankfully, I think that General Maxson fits that description.",
    "brenden:125": "[with scholarly authority] According to my research, the Knights Templar were a military brotherhood which focused upon the acquisition of wealth and knowledge. Although they had some religious overtones in their structure, their quest for knowledge ultimately made them a secular organization. I think that they would have been a more theocratic organization if they had a greater interest in wealth and power, since the church of that era was primarily involved in control of gold and land.",

    "sinthia:163": "[with a mocking laugh] Only that he thinks he doesn't have any. Well, that and he's a fat slob, who can't move for a damn. He's got to have his guards help him move around. Even then, they gotta use a little tricycle. Heh heh.",

    "jtgengrd:121": "[hesitantly] Well, uh, fine with me. [warningly] But you'd better be careful.",
    "jtgengrd:122": "[settling in, drawling] Good you asked. [matter-of-factly] No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If you start a fight, it's your fault. [relaxing slightly] Other than that, it's your right to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just cause. Have a good day.",
    "jtgengrd:123": "[shouting, exasperated] Hey you, no weapons! [dismissively] And I don't care if your momma dropped you on your head as a kid. No weapons.",

    "lars:112": "[matter-of-factly] Plenty, so long as you stay on our good side. We got Killian Darkwaters' store, where you can do some trading. And there's Gizmo's Casino, if you're a gambler. Or if you just want a drink, you can head on over to the Skum Pitt. Just don't get too rowdy.",
    "lars:114": "[sternly] Well, you'd best keep yourself under control. We're a free town but we don't tolerate stepping on other people's toes. Don't cause any problems and you won't give cause for me and my men to come down on you.",

    "lars:117": "[settling in, matter-of-factly] Me and my men here work for Killian Darkwater. We keep some order in this town, dealing with all of the murderers, thieves, and other scumbags who come in from the desert. If you want my advice, you'll also stay away from Gizmo. That fathead runs a crooked operation, but we just haven't been able to prove anything. He and his lackeys, the Skulz, are going to take the fall sometime soon, if Killian has anything to say about it.",
    "lars:121": "[warmly] Hey, it's our job. But it's good to know that someone appreciates it. Thanks.",
    "lars:122": "[sighing with frustration] Got to do it all proper like. We know that Gizmo runs a rigged operation and all, but we need hard evidence to bring him down. Same with the Skulz; they rough someone up, we bring one or two of 'em in, but nothing changes. We just don't have any direct evidence tying them to any of the killings or muggings.",
    "lars:125": "[eagerly] Hell, if you think you can get some dirt on either of them, we'd appreciate the help. Killian's the one to talk to if you want to talk about Gizmo. But if you can get some info on the Skulz, just come back to me and me and the boys will take care of them.",

    "lars:146": "[dismissively] That's great and all, but I can't just jail them all on one person's say-so. I need hard evidence or inside testimony.",
    "lars:149": "[with satisfaction] Excellent. I'll pick her up for a few questions, and I'm sure that I'll get all the information that I need to put them away.",
    "lars:150": "[sternly] Look, this isn't a game. People are getting hurt here. If you find some real evidence, come back, but otherwise, don't waste my time!",
    "lars:151": "[with a knowing tone] If you're not averse to a little skullduggery, I need someone to get some hard evidence on the Skulz, proving that they're involved in illegal activities here. Or you can talk to Killian; he might have some work for you.",

    "lars:169": "[angrily, with a note of reluctant respect] Wanderer, you just screwed up. We needed evidence so that we could take down Gizmo all nice and legal-like. Look, off the record, I'm happy to have that fat fuck out of the picture, but we can't condone murder. You better leave Junktown and never come back.",
    "lars:170": "[coldly threatening] We don't like your kind here. You've got about fifteen seconds before I blow your head off.",
    "lars:171": "[warmly] Hello again! What can I do for you?",

    "agatha:131": "How very true. [pausing thoughtfully] It is good for the young to remember, but it is very hard to act within the flow of history. Sometimes, the very course we take is determined by events long ago. May Dharma be with you. [wearily] I must rest for a little while. Come back again, when I am stronger, and we will speak again.",
    "agatha:132": "[appreciatively] Thank you for asking. [with quiet resignation] I'm just old, that's all. I cannot sleep at night. I close my eyes . . . [with a long, weary sigh] But I get no rest. Please, it is just my old tired bones . . .",

    "gretch:112": "[hesitantly] Um . . . okay.",
    "gretch:116": "[reassuringly] Yes, yes, almost done.",
    "gretch:120": "[matter-of-factly, breathing heavily] Body parts almost ready to go to Hub.",
    "gretch:124": "[happily, speaking slowly] Iguana man Bob send you . . . he happy, lots of good meat . . .",
    "gretch:128": "[simply, with a wheezy chuckle] For Bob to sell . . . to eat . . . why you ask what we use for?",
    "gretch:132": "[confusedly, scratching head] Me have trouble thinking, too . . . what we talk about?",
    "gretch:137": "[dismissively, turning away] I don't talk to you any more.",
    "gretch:138": "[proudly, matter-of-factly] Yes . . . Doc Morbid has best human bodies around. None better.",
    "gretch:140": "[with finality, breathing heavily] I go back to work now.",
    "gunther:102": "[warmly] Welcome to my humble house. What can I do for you?",
    "gunther:107": "[helpfully] Sure, what else would you like to know?",
    "gunther:108": "[gesturing conversationally] It is a sprawling city, the largest I have seen in my life. The center of the town lies to the south, with the other areas branching off in each direction from there.",
    "gunther:113": "[with a friendly drawl] I get everything that I need from Mitch down by the Maltese Falcon. Just head on south from here.",
    "gunther:114": "[chattily] I occasionaly do a stint on one of the caravans that head out from here. If you're looking for that kind of work, just talk to one of the trading houses. I'm partial to the Far Go Traders, but I've worked with all of them.",
    "gunther:115": "[recommending] Well, I buy most of my stuff from Beth over in the Weapon Store. Got a pretty good selection.",
    "gunther:118": "[leaning in conspiratorially] I've heard there is some guy over in Old Town that deals in stuff with a little more punch.",
    "gunther:119": "[with a knowing chuckle] Probably not, she's sweet on her bodyguard Sid. But, you might want to try Butch, he runs the Far Go Traders - which owns her store.",
    "gunther:120": "[matter-of-factly] I get by. I hire on with the caravans when I'm a little short on cash, and work for the farmers down south a bit.",
    "gunther:121": "[helpfully] Well, you probably passed Deputy Fry on your way down here. His boss is Sheriff Greene, and you'll find him in the Police Station most of the time.",
    "gunther:123": "[sympathetically, shaking head] I'm sorry, but you're not making any sense. Maybe Dr. Thorndyke with the Children can help you.",
    "gwen:101": "[with a sneering growl] I am Gwen. I'm one of Garl's advisors. Who are you?",
    "gwen:107": "[threateningly] As an advisor, I make sure that no low-lifes cause any trouble for Garl.",
    "gwen:112": "[dismissively, sneering] Hmpf. If you're nobody special then I won't bother talking to you. Go away.",
    "gwen:113": "[angrily] I keep idiots like you from bothering Garl. Go away!",
    "gwen:114": "[with menacing calm] I have ways to make certain undesirables are no longer here.",
    "gwen:118": "[with a raspy growl, excitedly] It's been so long since I've had a good fight. Too bad you are going to lose. Here is proof of my skills!",
    "gwen:119": "[coldly threatening] You'll regret that remark. It will be your last!",
    "gwen:120": "[with contemptuous slowness] If that is the best you can do, then I will be doing the world a favor by killing you.",
    "gwen:121": "[growling] Me and this army!",
    "gwen:122": "[with barely contained rage] You annoy me. Leave before I become truly angry.",
    "harry:191": "[with a deep, gravelly growl] You're not taking me anywhere!",
    "hbeth:101": "[warmly, cheerfully] Hi there. How can I help you?",
    "hbeth:117": "[excited, gossipy] Well, I'm not one to gossip, but I heard that Decker's death is somehow related to the assassination hit on Jain.",
    "hbeth:118": "[leaning in, whispering eagerly] Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but I know someone who knows someone that says that they saw three extremely large robed figures go into the Maltese Falcon right before the murders.",
    "hbeth:119": "[leaning in conspiratorially] Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but someone killed Jain, the High Priestess of the Children of the Cathedral. I don't care for them myself, but I don't know what she could have done to deserve that.",
    "hbeth:121": "[conspiratorially, quickly] Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but a merchant friend of mine saw a group of mutants wandering around in the desert up past the Brotherhood of Steel, far to the Northwest.",
    "hbeth:122": "[urgently, with concern] Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but the Children of the Cathedral have been asking people where you are. I'd be careful. They're a strange bunch.",
    "hbeth:123": "[excited, gossipy] Well, I'm not one to gossip, but I heard that Decker's death is somehow related to the assassination hit on Jain.",
    "hbeth:124": "[leaning in conspiratorially] There is something else. I know someone who knows someone that says that they saw three extremely large robed figures go into the Maltese Falcon right before the murders.",
    "hbeth:125": "[leaning in with hushed concern] There is something else. Someone killed Jain, the High Priestess of the Children of the Cathedral. I don't care for them myself, but I don't know what she could have done to deserve that.",
    "hbeth:126": "[leaning in urgently] There is something else. A merchant friend of mine saw a group of mutants wandering around in the desert up past the Brotherhood of Steel, far to the Northwest.",
    "hbeth:127": "[urgently, with warning] There is something else. The Children of the Cathedral have been asking people where you are. I'd be careful. They're a strange bunch.",
    "hbeth:131": "[confused] I'm sorry, what was that?",
    "hbeth:134": "[kindly, gently concerned] I'm sorry, I don't understand. Please come back when you are feeling better.",
    "hbeth:135": "[matter-of-factly, helpfully] Well I'm not hiring but there's a job post in the center of the Merchant Market, you might want to check there.",
    "hbeth:137": "[with a knowing grin] No, nothing good at least. Give me a chance to do some digging. [winking] Anything else?",
    "hbeth:140": "[warmly, helpfully] What else can I do for you?",
    "hbeth:141": "[cheerfully, with a friendly laugh] Of course you can, don't be silly.",
    "hbeth:142": "[warmly, eagerly] Why sure, I'd be happy to help. What did you need to know?",
    "hbeth:143": "[warmly, politely] All right. Well it's been nice talking to you, have a nice day.",
    "hbeth:144": "[brightly, cheerfully] No, that's all. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?",
    "hbeth:147": "[warmly, invitingly] Well come back soon. Don't be a stranger.",
    "hbeth:148": "[lowering voice, nervously] Now there's someone you don't ever want to mess with, he scares me. He 'owns' the Maltese Falcon.",
    "hbeth:151": "[sadly, nostalgically] Sorry, it just reminds me of a friend that used to own it before him. Decker wanted it really bad, but my friend wouldn't sell. Two days later they found him dead in a back alley of Old Town.",
    "hbeth:155": "[passionately, angrily] My friend was a clean freak. He wouldn't come within a hundred yards of Old Town. He was shot with a Magnum; no one in Old Town could afford one of those. Plus, he was shot once in the head and twice in the back. Does that sound like a robbery? My friend was just trying to get his life back.",
    "hbeth:160": "[seriously, with emotion] You probably don't understand, but most of us look forward to the day when we own our own lives. When our lives don't belong to the merchants or the money lenders.",
    "hbeth:164": "[cheerfully, helpfully] Is there anything else I can do for you?",
    "hbeth:165": "[sharply, defensively] Well, excuse me. YOU asked.",
    "hbeth:166": "[gravely, warning tone] He's the deadliest person in the Hub; most say that he runs this place, not the merchants or the police. If you ever cross him, watch out.",
    "hbeth:167": "[angrily, with conviction] That gives him no right to kill anyone.",
    "hbeth:168": "[coldly, with barely contained rage] You make me sick, please leave. I'm sure he's missing your company.",
    "hbeth:169": "[quickly, matter-of-factly] Well, there are three main merchant groups. There's the Water Merchants, the Crimson Caravan, and the Far Go Traders. They also run the city council. What do you want to know about?",
    "hbeth:177": "[dismissively, with distaste] They're in charge of all the water. Greedy people, I wouldn't want to work for them. Their pay is the worst and the jobs are just as bad.",
    "hbeth:182": "[brightly, invitingly] What else would you like to know about?",
    "hbeth:183": "[settling into explanation mode] No. From what I've heard, a while back a group of merchants seized control of the water tower and proclaimed that they were the water merchants and people had to get water from them. The merchant war raged on for years until a man named Roy Greene - yeah, Justin's Grandfather, that's it - helped to negotiate an agreement that ended the war.",
    "hbeth:188": "[getting heated, then catching herself] Well he set up the city council and set a limit on the price of water. Personally I think they should have beat the tar out of them - oh, sorry. I mean they should have showed them who's boss.",
    "hbeth:192": "[apologetically, sheepishly] Sorry I tend to get carried away with myself. Was there anything else you wanted to know about?",
    "hbeth:193": "[with concern, shaking head] The Crimson Caravan are a bunch of crazy people. They will do any job, no matter what the risk. I'm surprised they aren't missing more caravans than they are.",
    "hbeth:198": "[continuing matter-of-factly] They will pass right through an area known to be attacked by raiders. They charge a lot so they can hire extra hands. The pay's great but you have to be alive to spend it, right?",
    "hbeth:202": "[thoughtfully, with a shrug] Actually all the merchants have had a few caravans disappear. The Far Go Traders are just unlucky, I suppose.",
    "hbeth:206": "[warmly, with pride] The Far Go Traders pay well and their jobs aren't too deadly. Butch owns this shop, a good man. They're fair and let me do as I please with the place; I like working with them. Plus you get a discount on anything you buy here if you work for Butch.",
    "hbeth:207": "[dismissively] Personally I don't think so. I think it was the Deathclaw or maybe the Brotherhood of Steel.",
    "hbeth:215": "[firmly, with doubt] Some people think the Water Merchants are responsible, but I don't think so. I think it was that darn Deathclaw, or maybe the people over at the Brotherhood of Steel.",
    "hbeth:216": "[with conviction, slightly nervous] Well, I thought that it was destroying the caravans, but I guess not. It's still out there though. There are too many rumors floating around for it not to exist.",
    "hbeth:217": "[adamantly] I think that's what's taking the caravans. It could also be the Brotherhood of Steel; they're a strange bunch. Some people think it's the Water Merchants, but they're wrong.",
    "hbeth:218": "[simply, agreeing] Sure.",
    "hbeth:219": "[matter-of-factly] Because, like I've been telling everyone, they've had a few caravans disappear too. Nothing like what's happening to the Far Go Traders, but they are being affected.",
    "hbeth:226": "[sharply, defensively] Excuse you! You're awfully quick to judge, are you afraid of the truth?",
    "hbeth:227": "[settling in, matter-of-factly] There are six representatives two from each of the main merchant groups. Everything needs at least four votes to be passed. They can never agree on anything.",
    "hbeth:228": "[passionately, thoughtfully] Good thought, but I highly doubt it. They've been sabotaging each other for years, but this is not their style. They wouldn't spend that much money to take out the caravans. Plus all the caravans are very heavily guarded. You would think someone would escape. They don't have the man power or the cash to pull that off. There would have been at least one survivor.",
    "hbeth:233": "[philosophically, with a shrug] Bad luck? I don't know, maybe they're traveling along different routes than the others. Maybe because they aren't as heavily guarded as the Crimson Caravan but . . . they might have better cargo than the Water Merchants. Who knows. There doesn't seem to be any clear difference between the three.",
    "hbeth:239": "[sharply, with irritation] Excuse me! You're free to leave at any time. If you didn't want the answer you shouldn't have asked.",
    "hbeth:240": "[leaning in, urgently, almost afraid] The Deathclaw is the most evil thing to rise out of the ashes after the War. Some say it's a powerful ghost from the war that haunts the land. It's no ghost, it's as real as you and me. It's 20 feet tall with teeth as big as your arm. It's some kind of demon that found it's way here when the world was engulfed in fire.",
    "hbeth:245": "[excitedly, with amazement] Well, I know this old mutant in Old Town named Harold. He's seen it. He's the 'only' one that's seen it and lived.",
    "hbeth:252": "[dismissively, shaking head] Uncle Slappy over in Old Town talks about it sometimes, but he's just a crazy old fool.",
    "hbeth:256": "[ominously] You'll see!",
    "hbeth:257": "[animatedly, with a laugh] Yeah, pretty amazing isn't it. It's down to the southwest somewhere. There's an old mutant in Old Town named Harold who actually saw this thing in its lair. Nicest Skag I know.",
    "hbeth:266": "[uncertainly, trailing off] Well, um. I don't remember, but who ever it was wouldn't lie . . . I mean, it might be true! You should be careful just the same.",
    "hbeth:271": "[lowering voice conspiratorially] Why, you don't know? I heard that they make human sacrifices and do all sorts of other terrible things!",
    "hbeth:276": "[coldly, accusingly] Like you don't know. You're obviously one of them, walking around in that metal suit. You're all a bunch of sick people.",
    "hbeth:283": "[nervously, stammering, flustered] Uhh . . . well, yeah . . . umm You . . . I . . . Is there anything else you needed?",
    "hbeth:284": "[seriously, with concern] You never know what a person's really like behind closed doors. You've got to be careful with who you associate yourself with. Was there anything else you needed?",
    "hbeth:285": "[flustered, backtracking quickly, nervous laugh] You're a . . . ? I mean. I didn't mean . . . Umm . . . Lovely day we're having. Don't you think so? So, was there anything else I can do for you?",
    "hbeth:289": "[resigned, dismissively] Sure, whatever you say. Was there anything else that I can do for you?",
    "hbeth:297": "[brightly, matter-of-factly] Oh, that's right. You're working for Butch, you get the 15% discount.",
    "hbeth:330": "[extremely excitedly, with delight] Did you hear? He's dead! I'm overjoyed! That's the best thing that's ever happened to this city.",
    "hbeth:331": "[with relief, almost giddy] I already told you. He's dead! Let's just forget about him, his name brings back bad memories.",
    "hbeth:334": "[bursting with joy and gratitude] You did it? Really? I love you! [to Sid, warningly] Don't even think about it wise guy . . . Here, to show my gratitude . . . [gratefully] It's not much, but I really appreciate it!",
    "hbeth:335": "[warmly, enthusiastically] You did it? Really? You're the best! You have no idea how happy I was to hear that he was dead. Here take these . . . [gratefully] It's not much, but I really appreciate it!",
    "hbeth:395": "[simply, politely] Goodbye.",
    "hbeth:399": "[urgently, with warning] Oh yes. You ought to stay as far away from the Maltese Falcon as you possibly can. Decker and his greasy lapdog Kane are bad news. They'll eat you alive if you're not careful. I'd also give Lorenzo at the Friendly Lending company a wide berth.",
    "hchdgrd:103": "[dismissively] What do you want?",
    "hchdgrd:110": "[with menacing calm] I'm a hired hand. If anyone bothers these space cadets, I kill em. You got a problem with that?",
    "hchdgrd:117": "[sharply] Something called a Holy Flame. [scoffing] Don't listen to this bullshit, it'll rot your brain!",
    "hchdgrd:122": "[slowly, gravelly] Water chip? Do you mean like ice chips? Up in the mountains, maybe.",
    "hchdgrd:127": "[with a knowing sneer] Yeah, I heard about him. He's a real bastard, but he pays his bills. Phillips worked for him a few times.",
    "hchdgrd:132": "[gruffly satisfied] Yeah, this is the only one I'd want in a fire fight. What can I do for you?",
    "hchdgrd:138": "[firmly] Sorry pal, but I'm on duty. No small talk.",
    "hchdgrd:139": "[threateningly] Get the Hell out of my face before I kill you.",
    "hchdgrd:140": "[sarcastically biting] Way to go, Rocket Scientist! Who else could I be, Doc Morbid? Jeez!",
    "hchdgrd:141": "[scoffing sharply] The priest bitch. Who else did you think? Jeez!",
    "hchdgrd:142": "[with a gravelly shrug] I hate to admit it pal, but I've been out of the loop for weeks. You better ask someone else.",
    "hchdgrd:143": "[with disdainful amusement] Room and board and not much else. These religious types are cheap!",
    "hchdgrd:144": "[with aggressive readiness] Then let's solve it!",
    "hchdgrd:145": "[grudgingly] Fine. Because nobody likes a problem around here.",
    "hchdgrd:146": "[mockingly] It's gotta be a scam. Nobody's really dumb enough to believe all this religious shit. Could they?",
    "hchdgrd:147": "[with contemptuous dismissal] Yeah. It's a good thing that they aren't paying me to agree with them. Holy flame, my ass!",
    "hchdgrd:148": "[seriously, with grudging respect] I dunno. I can tell you one thing, whatever you can say about the religion, they're not amateurs. They came in and organized this place like clockwork. This isn't just another band of mindless zombies.",
    "hchdgrd:149": "[with sharp disbelief] Jeez, I thought only Vaults used that sort of crap!",
    "hchdgrd:150": "[threateningly] Watch your mouth, asshole. These people may believe in peace and love, but I don't!",
    "hchdgrd:151": "[curtly] No problem.",
    "hchdgrd:152": "[matter-of-factly] Nah. The higher you climb, the worse the radiation gets.",
    "hchdgrd:153": "[with a gravelly chuckle] Uh, if you like psychotic, stone cold ruthless bastards, then he's the man.",
    "hchdgrd:154": "[curtly informative] My partner. The guy who's guarding Jain.",
    "hchdgrd:155": "[with casual menace] It depends on how much risk you like. My life's been kinda busy lately, so I came here to lie low. But if you like action, sure. Just don't screw up or you're dead, that's all.",
    "hchdgrd:156": "[with a knowingness] I hear the Water Merchants are always packing the best shit. But people will say anything about the Water Merchants. It ain't here among this crowd, that's for damn sure.",
    "hchdgrd:157": "[with growing intensity] I been trying to get a good read on these guys for weeks. At first I thought they were fools, but now\u2026 [with serious conviction] I ain't sure. They're organized, and they've got a plan. I can smell it!",
    "hchdgrd:158": "[with a gravelly sneer] I hear Decker's got some action, but man, it's shitty work and if you screw up, you're as good as dead.",
    "hchdgrd:159": "[matter-of-factly] Water purification chip? You don't use well water? Good lord! I heard tell of a Vault near Shady Sands where you might find one, but that place is completely caved in. I don't think I can help you.",
    "hchdgrd:161": "[sharply] Hey, you!",
    "hchdgrd:162": "[with aggressive urgency] Hey! What do you think you're doing!",
    "hchdgrd:167": "[threateningly] None of your business! Get outta here!",
    "hchdgrd:168": "[with satisfaction] Good! Now get outta here!",
    "hchdgrd:169": "[with cold finality] Get lost! If you pull this sort of shit again, I'll kill you personally!",
    "heather:101": "[sharply, interrogating] What are you doing here?",
    "heather:107": "[suspiciously] Really? And what might you be looking for?",
    "heather:112": "[coldly, dismissive] Thank you, but I am already spoken for. I think it is time for you to leave.",
    "heather:113": "[with frustrated exasperation] Yes, the spy. I have heard of that bothersome pest. I really wish we could catch him.",
    "heather:118": "[muttering darkly] I bet it was the braggart Neil that said as much. I'll have to have a talk with him later.",
    "heather:122": "[with grim certainty] I am almost sure of it. I just need some proof.",
    "heather:126": "[tersely] Thank you. You don't know how much this means to me. Once you get proof, kill him.",
    "heather:127": "[matter-of-factly, clipped] What is there not to know? He has access to the Children. He works during the night when most are asleep. It has to be him.",
    "heather:130": "[coldly threatening] I am truly sorry that you think that way. I cannot have someone think I am a spy. I will remove you from service.",
    "heather:131": "[with hard certainty] He has access to the Children during the night. No one ever sees him on duty. It must be him.",
    "heather:134": "[suspiciously calculating] I am not certain as to who it is. I think it may either be a guard or a scholar. They keep sneaking into the Children's Cathedral at night.",
    "heather:138": "[curtly] Not really. Just that I think it is a male and probably a scholar or guard.",
    "heather:140": "[grimly] True. We scouts do many raids on the Children, and to much loss lately. This spy costs us dearly.",
    "heather:144": "[sharply defensive] Why would one of us do that?",
    "heather:148": "[with growing suspicion] Sounds like a good thought. I've noticed Peter never gets attacked much in the raids. I think he may be the one.",
    "heather:151": "[taken aback, dangerously quiet] You think that it is me?",
    "heather:154": "[clipped, dismissive] Then wonder somewhere else. I must get back to work.",
    "heather:155": "[muttering anxiously] I think he thinks I am the spy. But I'm not.",
    "heather:158": "[defensively] Because I am the new scout. I've only been here for about a year and the trouble started about five months ago.",
    "heather:161": "[coldly firm] Then look elsewhere. This is no place for you.",
    "heather:162": "[with a knowing edge] If you need information, look to Nicole. She thinks she knows everything.",
    "heather:163": "[offering a deal, calculating] I can be persuaded to tell you something that's going on. For a price.",
    "heather:167": "[flatly mercenary] Three hundred caps and the information is yours.",
    "heather:170": "[briskly businesslike] There will be a raid on the south end of the Children's stronghold. Now go.",
    "heather:171": "[furiously] Trying to cheat me? I'll show you!",
    "heather:172": "[coldly formal] I'm sorry you feel that way. But, good day to you.",
    "heather:173": "[with bitter practicality] I need to get by somehow. Now, do you want in or not?",
    "heather:176": "[curtly] Nothing. Now leave.",
    "higheld:101": "[clipped and commanding] Greetings Initiate. I need to speak with you.",
    "higheld:111": "[sharply] Good. First go talk to Maxson if you haven't already. Report back to me when you've checked the northern territory. After that, we'll decide what to do with Maxson.",
    "higheld:113": "[with impatient snap] Have you explored the entire northern territory?",
    "higheld:116": "[tersely] And what do you have to report?",
    "higheld:118": "[biting] I didn't think so. You weren't gone for very long. Now, get back out there and don't come back until you have a FULL report.",
    "higheld:120": "[formally] I will inform the Elders. We will wait for Maxson's word on what to do. Go inform him on what you've found. Thanks for your help, Initiate.",
    "higheld:122": "[with cold authority] Then you will make time to hear me out.",
    "higheld:126": "[measured but direct] I understand. If you do travel up into that area and find anything, please, let me know.",
    "higheld:128": "[with gruff satisfaction] Good work with the mutants. We already heard that you destroyed their production facility. Thanks for taking care of that problem for us.",
    "higheld:130": "[sharply incredulous] Err? What kind of response is Err? Leave! Now!",
    "higheld:139": "[cutting through the air] And what did these mutants look like?",
    "higheld:142": "[calmly methodical] As you may know, our Head Scribe, Vree, has done an autopsy on a creature very similar to what you have just described. Do you believe these are the same?",
    "higheld:144": "[pointedly] What threat do you assume these \"mutants\" pose?",
    "higheld:146": "[coldly logical] Frankly, your report has not shown us any proof that they are a threat to us. What proof can you give that they have hostile intentions.",
    "higheld:149": "[pressing forward] So, by these actions they are taking, it is feasable that they will eventually come here?",
    "higheld:151": "[skeptically] I don't believe that shows hostility. They could simply be protecting themselves from attack. Even we have to deal with the occasional attack.",
    "higheld:154": "[with dry skepticism] What do you suggest? A preemptive strike at their military base?",
    "higheld:157": "[with finality] So be it. You shall have three Paladins of my choosing to meet you at the Military Base to help you get inside. Elders, thank you for your time. Best of luck to you Initiate.",
    "higheld:162": "[with finality] So be it. You shall have two Paladins of my choosing to meet you at the Boneyard Cathedral. Elders, thank you for your time. Best of luck to you Initiate.",

The best stuff you can find this side of the Brotherhood, and since the Brotherhood doesn't deal with outsiders, I've gotta' say I'm the best.

I've got a Geiger counter, too. Very rare.",

The Rads just keep building up. [with a slight pause] Well... unless you can get a hold of some Rad-Away.",

[with a note of concern] The worst part is you won't even know you've been sucking up Rads until a few days later. Get over 1000 and you're cooked [with emphasis] - unless you get a hold of a whole lot of Rad-Away.",

    "jason:111": "[voice cracking with emotion] I never thought that we would be able to stop fighting the gangs. My father told me how you got them to promise to leave us alone. You know, I thought I always wanted to go adventuring, but I think that I like . . . well, the",

    "jennifer:164": "[with slightly exasperated patience] I don't know if it's because you're an outsider or because of your extreme . . . lack of tact? So, 'honey', is there anything else I can do for you?",

    "jennifer:181": "[regretfully] Well, yes, you are a member of the Brotherhood, but the Elders have put a hold on all training of new Initiates.",
    "jennifer:184": "[explanatorily] There are rumors about some kind of army. I think the Elders want to concentrate their resources on the ones that are already far enough along in their training to make a difference if we do have a big battle on our hands.",
    "jennifer:185": "[with measured conviction] We strongly believe that training a few fighters extremely well is better than giving mediocre training to a bunch of fighters. Saving lives is one of our primary objectives.",
    "jennifer:186": "[encouragingly] You could probably get quite a bit out of the training just by watching. Brother Thomas is the best trainer we have ever had at the Brotherhood.",

    "jon:113": "[with menacing intensity] Good, then you know how ruthless and bloodthirsty they can be. The Blades are the worst of them all, I'm afraid.

    "jon:117": "[strain in voice] Well, the Regulators keep them from attacking us outright, but it's all they can do to keep our little community safe.

    "jtbob:120": "[defensively, talking fast] They cheat. I played a little slots and some poker. But I'm a better player than that. I swear those machines are rigged. [voice cracking with frustration] I lost a lot of money.",
    "jtbob:124": "[bitterly, muttering] Some goons. They say they work for the Casino Boss, but I never saw him. One was called Izo, I think, and the other was some big Guido looking guy. [angrily] Damn cheaters.",
    "jtbob:128": "[anxiously rambling] Oh, not too much. A couple thousand. I only played for four or five hours. Well, maybe a little longer. [nervous laugh] They gave me some markers, and I don't have enough here to cover it. I gotta get back to the Hub and get some cash. [fearfully] I'm afraid they'll beat me up if I try to leave.",
    "jtbob:133": "[startled, pitch high] Hey, what are you doing in my room? [suspiciously] Are you from the Casino?",
    "jtbob:138": "[sighing with relief] Oh gosh. I thought you were from the Casino. You scared me.",
    "jtbob:141": "[quietly, ashamed] Well, I got into some trouble there. I owe them a lot of money.",

    "jtbob:151": "[with desperate confidence, talking fast] Good, good. I just need a couple more days, and I'll make their money back and much more. [boastfully, unconvincingly] I'm a better gambler than they think.",

    "kane:293": "[with cold satisfaction] I understand that you are responsible for the death of Jain, the High Priestess. I don't know what quarrels you had with her and I don't care, but we're very grateful nevertheless. (Kane gives you 1000 hubbucks)",
    "kane:297": "[coldly] That is none of your concern and I'm afraid we can not deal with you. [with dark irony] You've violated our laws but because of the problem you eliminated for us we will not kill you, but I think you should leave.",

They're on the corner of Barter Street and Thunder Ave. in the Heights, he'll probably have guards. Try to be quiet about it and be sure you aren't seen, but if anyone does happen to see you [with quiet menace] make sure they don't live to tell anyone about it. [coldly] Once you've finished your little errand come back here. One more thing. [with dark emphasis] Don't even think about going to the police, that's the worst mistake you could ever make. If you can, try not attract their attention when doing your work, they can be quite a pain sometimes. [Kane gives you 500 caps]",

[matter-of-factly] Here's your last payment for the first job and the first payment for the second. (Kane hands you 3500 Hubbucks).

    "kane:304": "[with mild amusement] Were you in a hurry to get out of here? You didn't get your scripts. Here's your money, initial payment and the completion bonus for the first job. (Kane hands you 3000 Hubbucks)",

    "kane:453": "[with lethal cold stare, then slowly] Well then... I'll try to get you in to see him sometime soon. [with sinister quiet] I'll be sure to show you to him 'piece' by 'piece'.",

    "kane:456": "[after a long pause, with quiet finality] All right. I'll give you one last chance to see him. Follow me.",
    "kane:457": "[coldly] You missed your chance. Beat it.",
    "kane:458": "[explosively] What the hell are you doing back here?!?! [with scathing contempt] You must be an even bigger idiot than I thought. I knew Decker shouldn't have hired an unknown.",
    "kane:461": "[lowering voice, with furious intensity] You cocked up the mission, you moron! You were supposed to kill both of the Hightowers, not wound them for Christ sake! [rapidly, angrily] The second you left the Heights they ran off with their guards. Believe me, they didn't waste time packing either. God knows where they are now!",
    "kane:464": "[coldly] Sorry doesn't cut it. You've put Decker at an unacceptable risk. [with finality] You can consider yourself an enemy of the Underground from now on. I don't ever want to see your face in here again.",

    "katja:107": "[with interest] And what, may I ask, are you doing in the Boneyards?",
    "katja:112": "[matter-of-factly] You learn to be careful out here. So what are you doing here?",
    "katja:113": "[gruffly] All right, fair enough. I'm called Katja. What's it matter to you?",
    "katja:117": "[sharply] You might, but you're on my home turf, not vice-versa. So put up or shut up.",
    "katja:119": "[dismissively] A water purification chip? Sorry, don't know anything about that. Don't see much of that kind of tech here in the Boneyards, except maybe the stuff Miles works on.",
    "katja:123": "[skeptically] Just a traveler. I've heard that one before. Nobody comes to the Boneyard except those Hub merchants and people looking for a quick death at the hands of the gangs. What are you really here for?",
    "katja:126": "[matter-of-factly] Damn straight. But that's a two-way street.",
    "katja:127": "[studying you] Maybe. You definitely aren't one of those gangland shiv-shovers. What do you want?",
    "katja:137": "[informatively] Miles lives in Adytum. He's a scientist, mostly working with chemistry. If anyone could scrounge up a water chip or make a replacement, it would be him.",
    "katja:139": "[reflectively] Adytum is my original home. A little too boring for me, though. It's a fenced-off and self-sufficient town in the south end of the Boneyard, but not as far as the Cathedral. We trade sometimes with the Hub.",
    "katja:140": "[with a knowing tone] I've dealt with them before. They're not too bad, as far as gangs go. They have a hide-out in an old club, with some outposts. If you're careful you might even be able to get some of them to talk.",
    "katja:141": "[urgently] The Rippers are just plain ferocious. They're an inbred bunch that delights in torture and murder. I stay away from them, and you should, too. They actually put fuckin' land mines around their fortress.",
    "katja:142": "[matter-of-factly] The Gun Runners used to be a real gang, but they went soft. They started setting up a deal where they trade weapons that they get from their victims or buy from the Hub. Since nobody here is up for the trip to the Hub personally, they do pretty good business, even though their prices are high.",
    "katja:143": "[sarcastically] The Followers of the Apocalypse are a group of peace-preachers who live in a large library near the heart of the Boneyard. Why they haven't been wiped out yet I can't say. They are lousy combatants and have no understanding of the real world, but other than that they are polite and well-educated.",
    "katja:144": "[with resignation] The Boneyard is a pretty hostile place. I've never had the opportunity to leave, though I suppose I'd take it. Let's see . . . just south of here you have the Cathedral. There's some sort of cult there, but I stay away from them. Something sinister is going on there. Also, I've heard about the trading center called the Hub, and caravans occasionally show up, but I've never been there.",
    "katja:148": "[eagerly] No kidding. If you're looking for another hand, I'll sign on. Better than spending the rest of my existence in this hellhole, right?",
    "katja:152": "[quickly] This area's overrun with the three gangs - the Blades, Rippers, and Gun Runners - as well as serving as home for the Followers and for my own home, Adytum.",
    "katja:153": "[with determination] All right, looks like we've got a little ass-kicking to do!",
    "katja:154": "[seriously] Look, 90% of the people in this city fall into one or more of three categories - rapists, murderers, or thieves. I'm a thief and you actually seem polite, so that makes me wonder, okay? Call it a survival instinct.",
    "katja:158": "[tersely] Okay, but make it quick.",
    "katja:159": "[with dry humor] Huh. Guess I can't argue with that logic. So waddya want?",
    "katja:163": "[with casual interest] What's up?",
    "katja:169": "[impatiently] You again? What're you back for now?",
    "katja:178": "[matter-of-factly] I learned how to be a scrapper from my time in the Boneyard. I'm good with knives and submachine guns. My favorite is throwing knives, of course.",
    "katja:179": "[with a slight edge] All right, although I don't feel right without a good knife.",
    "katja:181": "[abruptly] What do you want now?",
    "katja:191": "[coldly dismissive] I'm sorry but I just don't understand you. Good bye.",
    "kenny:103": "[with barely contained emotion] There you are. I've been waiting for you to return. [voice cracking] We heard the Sheriff was killed during the battle. [sadly] It's hard to believe he's really gone. [softly, grieving] He was like a father to me.",
    "kenny:104": "[clearing throat, composing himself] The Sheriff gave me instructions to carry out in the event that he did not return from the mission. [professionally, though strained] He asked me to give you the remainder of your reward. I believe it was 1000 caps. [handing over the caps] Here you go.",
    "kenny:105": "[with solemn respect] This city owes you a debt of thanks. [voice wavering slightly] I only wish the Sheriff could be here to thank you himself. [quietly, emotionally drained] Goodbye.",

    "keri:126": "[dismissively] Whatever. [with gravelly temptation] If you get the urge for some action come back and I'll hook you up on the next caravan out.",
    "keri:127": "[exasperatedly] Hey! [with a raspy sigh] I know you can get some good chems here, but I'm not supposed to hire you unless your sober.",

    "keri:131": "[with a raspy chuckle, slipping you items] (On the way back she slips you a few things.)",
    "keri:132": "[with gravelly amusement] Well, you can last for QUITE a while.",
    "keri:133": "[appraisingly, with gravelly challenge] Well, you 'are' interesting and 'very' different from most people\u2026 [with cocky provocation] show me what you've got tough guy. [leading confidently] (She leads you around a corner)",

    "keri:144": "[with weary understanding] Well\u2026 I know how easy it is to be tempted to steal, but\u2026 [with gravelly firmness] Hell, I'll give you a chance. [threateningly] Don't show your face around here again and I won't call the cops. [dismissively] Now beat it.",

However, I'm missing some information which could give me the last few clues to the formula and reagents necessary.

    "missbro:124": "[raspy, appreciative] Well, thanks again. [slowly] I am going to stay with some friend of mine until I regain my strength. [whispering, urgently] By the way, I'd watch it around here. [weakly] I heard my hosts talking about some Thieves' Circle. [struggling] I guess we're close to their territory or something. [breathlessly] I think that might be why they were talking about moving to a different location. Bye.",

    "rutger:279": "[coldly firm] You've got to be joking? I may be very grateful for what you've done, but I'm afraid that doesn't change the past. I think you should leave.",
    "rutger:280": "[curtly] Didn't you hear me? We won't hire you. Please leave.",
    "rutger:281": "[skeptically] I don't think that will be very affective, but you can work on one if you like.",
    "rutger:285": "[with casual encouragement] Great. Be sure to ask around.",
    "rutger:286": "[cooperatively] Well, okay. Just talk to our caravan driver by the front door when you're ready to go. Just as long as you do a good job our drivers will hire you.",
    "rutger:287": "[dismissively friendly] Of course! You don't need to talk to me. Just talk to our caravan driver.",
    "rutger:289": "[reassuringly matter-of-fact] Well sure, we may be losing a lot of caravans, but it is a very small percentage of our total business. The chances of you being on a caravan that is attacked by whatever is 'completely' capturing or destroying our caravans is very unlikely. Who or what ever is doing this must have a pretty large force, or a very deadly one.",

    "sammael:117": "[darkly] Well, you got the DeathClaws out there, and then you got the Regulators back here in Adytum. Both ain't the most forgiving types.",
    "sammael:121": "[gravely] We only work at night, and we're good at what we do. But I'll admit not everyone always comes back. [concerned] I sent a guy out last week to look for some parts for Miles, and we haven't heard from him since. The last transmission I got from him was that he'd found the parts, and was on his way back.",
    "sammael:122": "[obligingly] I've done a little scouting. Who do you want to know about?",
    "sammael:129": "[with sardonic disdain] The Blades are a pretty sorry sight for a group of people. They get by though, and some of them end up here in Adytum if they agree to what the Regulators offer them to do.",
    "sammael:130": "[warningly] Well if you haven't seen them before. They're mean as all hell, and like nothing more than to rip a poor Scav's heart out.",
    "sammael:131": "[cautiously] I've heard there's a nest of them somewhere to the east of the Blades, but I haven't seen it myself.",
    "sammael:132": "[with grim resignation] The Gun Runners moved into a big factory up to north-east not long ago. Can't tell you much because they have a moat filled with radioactive sludge, and you gotta get through the Deathclaws to get there.",
    "sammael:133": "[with wry amusement] The Followers preach peace and tolerance. Nice idea, but impractical. They live in a big library to the north-west of us.",
    "sammael:134": "[with unsettled intrigue] The Children of the Cathedral are based out of a big church a ways to the south of here. There are some strange things going on there. I've seen creatures that can't be human coming in and out of there.",
    "sammael:135": "[ominously] And if the stories are right, the church is built over an old Vault, which Adytum's predecessors lived in.",

    "slappy:131": "[rapid-fire rambling] I do this, then I do that. [suddenly distracted] You see Harold? [admiringly] Harold's fun, his hair falls out, falls in the wind. [trailing off, dreamily] There it goes... wind, wind.",

This is a place where differences are forgotten and we seek a future of unity and prosperity for all. A future where the horrors that our ancestors inflicted on us can never happen again!",
    "slummer:214": "[with zealous righteousness] Our enemies slander us! People are so easily frightened, especially when someone tells them what to do! But since I follow the Master and the Holy Flame, I don't have to be afraid any more. The Master told me not to be afraid!",

    "slummer:287": "[with resolute conviction] We must submit to the Master and the Holy Flame. When we have proven ourselves, we shall become baptized and closer to God. When all have been baptized, we shall be as one, a Unity under the Master!",
    "slummer:293": "[with passionate urgency] We have a right to survive. The ancients tried to survive and keep their freedom, and look at what they did to us! We must not make the same mistakes. Unity is the only solution. It's the only way to save what humanity has become!",

    "slummer:322": "[with absolute certainty] Of course he won't. He's the Master. He would never do that to his disciples. It is his holy power through baptism, and the Holy Flame, that will transform us. The virus is an evil of the old time, which I'm sure will be cleansed.",

    "talus:138": "[directing] Just see Michael in the next room for the supplies.",
    "talus:141": "[knowingly] Well, we are all important, but I know who you are referring to.",
    "talus:142": "[reassuringly] That's not a problem. You should get to know your fellow Brothers well. I know there are a lot of us, and that it can be hard for some to remember us all.",
    "talus:143": "[informatively] There's Rhombus. He's our Head Paladin, also known as the Master Knight. Then there's Vree; she's the Master Scribe. And of course we cannot forget our distinguished High Elder, Maxson.",
    "talus:147": "[with deep affection] Rhombus is my best friend, mentor, idol, and father figure all combined into one. He's a little rough, but he has to be, to be in the position he's in.",
    "talus:148": "[helpfully] If you ever need to talk to him, he is normally in his office . . . I mean room. That's on the other side of this level, across from the guard room.",
    "talus:149": "[simply] Of course we do. She's on the second level. Next to the learning room.",
    "talus:152": "[with genuine admiration] Vree is one of the most intelligent people I've ever known. I think she was born with the natural understanding of physics and chemistry.",
    "talus:153": "[informatively] She spends every waking moment doing research or analyzing and reanalyzing anything she can get her hands on. If you ever need to talk to her, she can normally be found in her room, on the third floor.",
    "talus:154": "[directing] She's on the second level. Just go down to the second floor, make a left. You'll see it just past the learning room. I should get back to work. If you have any other questions just ask.",
    "talus:155": "[matter-of-factly] As I said, she's on the second level. You can't miss it. It's the only other major room on the second floor besides the learning room.",
    "talus:157": "[with respectful pride] Maxson is one tough old man. He's the great, great grandson . . . or was it great, great, great grandson? Well, anyway. He's the descendant of one of our founding fathers. He, of course, is the High Elder.",
    "talus:158": "[with measured approval] You've built quite a reputation for yourself. The people I've checked with hold you in high regard. I don't think you need any help, you seem quite capable. However, if you help me with a little problem, I might be able to reward you with something.",
    "talus:161": "[irritably] You're getting on my nerves, little one. What do you want now?",
    "talus:166": "[sharply] Stop wasting my time!",
    "talus:167": "[coldly commanding] How did you get in here? Get out of my sight.",
    "talus:168": "[accommodatingly] I can give you a little more ammunition if you really need it. I'll have it authorized by the time you can talk to Michael.",
    "talus:169": "[with slight disapproval] I just gave you some. You should learn to be more conservative with your ammunition.",
    "talus:170": "[firmly] Sorry, you've had more than your share for this week. You'll have to make do with what you have. We don't have an endless supply of ammunition.",
    "talus:171": "[coldly, with barely restrained anger] I've heard about some of the things you've done and we don't take kindly to child killers. The Elders seem to think that there's something you can offer but I don't want to have anything to do with you.",
    "talus:175": "[with controlled approval] You've built quite a reputation for yourself. I don't think you need any help, you seem quite capable. However, there is something I need looking into, and I might be able to help you if you can help me.",
    "talus:179": "[with measured respect] Since you were able to survive the wasteland alone, I think you're probably quite capable. However, I do have a problem that I could use some help with and I might be able to reward you for your help.",
    "talus:180": "[firmly] No. I think you should leave.",
    "talus:181": "[with concern] I sent one of our Initiates out to the Hub a short while back and we haven't heard back from him. If you can find out what happened to him I'd be very grateful.",
    "talus:184": "[sharply commanding] I told you to leave.",
    "talus:185": "[with finality] Only? I don't think our order will be able to help you. Good day.",
    "talus:186": "[dismissively] I don't need to know the whole story. Good day.",
    "talus:187": "[warmly] Thank you. I'll remember this and when I've seen that you've gained enough experience I might be able to give you something special from our order.",
    "talus:191": "[guardedly] I shouldn't say, but it's not a weapon. It's something that only the elite in our order can have, but since you are from the outside and are in greater need of it, I might be able to make an exception.",
    "talus:194": "[knowingly] I think you probably already have an idea. Let's leave it at that.",
    "talus:195": "[coldly, with disdain] No, I'm not and I think you should leave, 'initiate'.",
    "talus:196": "[with measured authority] Only Paladins wear Power Armor, someday you may earn the right to wear it.",
    "talus:198": "[with a sardonic chuckle, leaning back] Well I see we have a bright new addition to our order after all... Don't get cocky with me, Initiate. [sternly] I'm not in the mood nor have I the patience!",
    "talus:199": "[with sharp disapproval] I thought you were smarter than that. I don't have to give you anything. You're lucky I don't kick you out of here, right now. I think you should leave, before I change my mind.",
    "talus:200": "[reassuringly] That's okay. Anything you might find would be helpful.",
    "talus:207": "[warmly, with genuine relief] Hello stranger! I heard you're the one to thank for the safe return of my missing Initiate.",
    "talus:209": "[with stern disapproval] We don't tolerate chem users around here. I suggest you see the doctor and clean yourself up.",
    "talus:210": "[matter-of-factly] As for your reward, I'll give you the choice of one of the following:",
    "talus:216": "[efficiently] I'll key your authorization in right now. Go pick it up from Michael.",
    "talus:218": "[with slight disappointment, but accepting] I see someone else already gave you your Power Suit. I was hoping to give it to you myself, but that's all right. I hope it helps you in your quest.",
    "talus:406": "[with cautious skepticism] Hmmm, I don't know. You may have proven yourself to be an initiate but that doesn't mean we start handing over weapons to someone that might not be qualified, especially an outsider, no offense.",
    "talus:101": "Hello, you must be the outsider initiate. Nice to meet you. What can I do for you?",
    "taylor:102": "[with friendly curiosity] We don't get many strangers around here. What do you want?",
    "taylor:103": "[brightly, with enthusiasm] Hello, stranger! What can I do for you today?",
    "taylor:110": "[casually] Yeah, I trade with 'em.",
    "taylor:111": "[speaking quickly and matter-of-factly] I do some trading with them from time to time. Mostly I sell bullets in exchange for food.",
    "taylor:112": "[with a warm, welcoming tone] I'm Tine. You have some business to conduct?",
    "taylor:113": "[cheerfully] Pleasure to meet you. I'm Tine.",
    "taylor:114": "[with genuine warmth] Great doin' business with you. Come again.",
    "taylor:115": "[dismissively] Whatever.",
    "taylor:116": "[brightly] Keep in touch!",
    "taylor:117": "[with confused friendliness] What?",
    "taylor:118": "[with peppy enthusiasm] Hello again! What can I help you with?",
    "taylor:119": "[speaking openly, with a knowing smile] It's a good town. Might be a little happier if the Regulators didn't keep such a tight grip on things. But hey, that's their style.",
    "taylor:120": "[conversationally upbeat] Ain't a bad little town. Zimmerman's a fair man, maybe not the brightest guy. And of course we've got Miles, probably the only man in a hundred miles who knows anything about science.",
    "tguard:105": "[cautiously] Welcome, stranger. We don't see your kind often.",
    "tguard:109": "[suspiciously] Not so fast! This is a small community. We don't see strangers often, and we don't really need them if you get my meaning. If you don't have a good reason to be here, you'd better just keep moving.",
    "tguard:112": "[defensively] I wasn't saying that you was gonna. You'd just better leave us alone.",
    "tguard:115": "[with a warning drawl] Look, Shady Sands don't need your kind from the Hub, or Junktown, or wherever you come from. We do pretty good by ourselves.",
    "tguard:116": "[bitterly] The last trader from the Hub sold us a malfunctioning irrigation pump. [grudgingly] We've had it with your dirty deals.",
    "tguard:118": "[skeptically, with a drawn-out] Yeah, right. So you say. Just don't get into any trouble, Ok?",
    "tguard:121": "[cautiously reconsidering] Well, maybe you aren't. You do seem a little different to me. [with resigned acceptance] I'll tell you what. You should go talk to Aradesh. He is in the center of town.",
    "theresa:106": "[passionately] It's good to hear that. I knew that the outside world couldn't be as bad as everyone says. I mean, our ancestors lived outside, right? [exasperated] But that paranoid Overseer won't let us leave.",
    "theresa:111": "[sympathetically] Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. [hopefully] I hope that you're able to find the chip soon.",
    "theresa:114": "[scoffing] Hmm. I suppose it was too much to hope that the outside world had taught you to communicate. [dismissively] Oh well.",
    "theresa:115": "[angrily] And I suppose he chose you to go outside because he knew that you were under his thumb! [with heated conviction] He really just doesn't want to give up his control over us.",
    "theresa:118": "[sarcastically] Hmm. From what I've read, the outside isn't really all that dangerous. [condescendingly] But I suppose that you would know better than I, wouldn't you?",
    "theresa:119": "[passionately] I knew that the outside couldn't be too bad. [determined] That's why I've been trying to convince some people to come outside with me. I think that we have a better chance of survival out there.",
    "theresa:122": "[thoughtfully] I suppose. I always figured that he just had some sort of power trip. [reluctantly] But I guess that he wouldn't be the Overseer if he wasn't really concerned about our welfare, would he? [with resignation] I guess we should just wait and see if you can find the chip.",
    "theresa:124": "[shouting] Oh, come on! Wake up! [angrily] If he thinks the outside is so dangerous, then how come he sent you out there? [contemptuously] The man just has a control complex. You're a stupid tool and you don't even know it!",
    "theresa:125": "[sarcastically] Honestly, if he thought that the outside was that dangerous, he'd have sent a whole team with weapons and equipment, not just you. [with bitter insight] But you're his pawn, since he doesn't want anyone to realize what they're missing.",
    "theresa:126": "[exasperatedly] Oh, get real! [challengingly] Do you really think that we can live in this Vault generation after generation? Maybe you can find a new chip, but what happens when the next thing breaks down? [with mounting frustration] And the next?",
    "theresa:129": "[matter-of-factly] A lot of us think so. [determined] That's why we're planning to take some supplies and head out in a few days. [hopefully] Say, do you have any advice for us?",
    "theresa:132": "[curtly] Okay. Well, thanks.",
    "theresa:133": "[angrily, dismissively] Oh, just go away! We don't need the help of one of the Overseer's pawns!",
    "theresa:134": "[formally, welcoming] Welcome to our meeting! As you have been picked by the Overseer to go outside, perhaps you can give us some advice before our move to the outdoors as well.",
    "theresa:139": "[sarcastically, cutting] Thank you so much. I can see you're going to be a big help. [coldly] Why don't you just leave?",
    "theresa:142": "[pointedly] Really? Considering our position, our lack of water, and the original purpose of this Vault, why do you think that we should stay?",
    "theresa:145": "[with cautious interest] Well, considering that you have some experience with the outside, perhaps you have some valuable points to make.",
    "theresa:148": "[firmly] If you can't give us good reasons why we shouldn't leave, then we're not going to wait here and die of water poisoning. [warningly] Please don't get in our way.",
    "theresa:151": "[urgently] It's only a matter of time before we run out of water here. [defiant] But the Vault was never meant to keep people inside forever! We have the people and the supplies to move outside now. [passionately] We have a better chance.",
    "theresa:154": "[thoughtfully] Hmm. Perhaps you're right. There are probably other survivors out there, and they could be hostile, too. [reluctantly accepting] I guess we will need to wait for everyone else to be ready.",
    "theresa:155": "[confidently] We're well-prepared now. We have equipment and simulator training. [determinedly] A few hazards outside are better than dying slowly of thirst!",
    "theresa:158": "[grudgingly] I don't like it, but I suppose we will wait until everyone is ready to leave together.",
    "theresa:170": "[urgently, pleadingly] Please hurry and find the water chip. We cannot wait much longer.",
    "theresa:172": "[gratefully, with warmth] I didn't think you would succeed, but you did a good job. Thank you for saving us all.",
    "theresa:175": "[coldly, with finality] We've been over this before. Leave us alone.",
    "thomas2:101": "[warmly, with a slight yawn] Why, hello there. You must be the new Initiate Talus told me about. It's awfully late for a social call, what can I do for you?",
    "thomas2:108": "[groggily] What could you possibly want at this hour?",
    "thomas2:109": "[muttering irritably] I don't have time for this.",
    "thomas2:110": "[exasperated] What? Do I look like requisition man? If you don't even know who I am, why are you bothering me? [more gently] Please leave!",
    "thomas2:113": "[tiredly dismissive] Well, why are you bothering me about it? Michael's probably asleep right now, unless Talus has him on sentry duty. Check at the supply room in the morning.",
    "thomas2:114": "[softening, with a warm sigh] Well, the Elders said no new initiate training but...sure. You seem like a nice young lad. I'd hate for something to happen to you out there, when I might have been able to help. What are you looking to train in?",

    "thomas2:125": "[gruffly but good-natured] Why I ought to throw you right out of my room, but I'm a nice old man. The Elders said no new initiate training but...I might be able to help. They probably didn't have you in mind when they said that. What are you looking to train in?",
    "thomas2:126": "[with genuine warmth and a chuckle] Why hello again. Nice to see you. Don't be shy, I don't sleep very much anymore. Are you looking for some more training? What shall it be today...I mean tonight.",
    "thomas2:127": "[with an affectionate, raspy laugh] I knew you would be back! What're you in the mood for tonight?",
    "thomas2:138": "[kindly, with a slight drawl] No problem. Let me know if you change your mind.",
    "thomas2:139": "[muttering wearily] I don't know why I'm wasting my time with you.",
    "thomas2:140": "[settling in patiently] Yes? Oh, I suppose you're looking for more training. Well, I don't sleep much anymore anyhow, why not. What shall it be?",
    "thomas2:142": "[warmly reassuring] Oh, that's all right. As I said, I hardly ever sleep. Come back anytime.",
    "thomas2:143": "[with mock-gruff exasperation] Well, stop pestering me then. I'm an old man and I need my beauty sleep.",

A little south of here is the Crash House, run by Marcelles, where you can get a night's sleep for way too many caps. Past that is Killian's. Killian runs a general store, and he also enforces the law in this town - a good man. Then south of there you have Doc Morbid, whose operation is a little funny, if you take my meaning.",
